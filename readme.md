CHAI3D - The Open Source Haptic Framework
-----------------------------------------


Introduction
============


First launched in 2003 at the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence 
Laboratory at Stanford University, CHAI3D is a powerful cross-platform 
C++ simulation framework with over 100+ industries and research 
institutions developing CHAI3D based applications all around the world 
in segments such as automotive, aerospace, medical, entertainment and 
industrial robotics.

Designed as a platform agnostic framework for computer haptics, 
visualization and interactive real-time simulation, CHAI3D is an open 
source framework that supports a variety of commercially-available 
three-, six- and seven-degree-of-freedom haptic devices, and makes it 
simple to support new custom force feedback devices.

CHAI3D's modular capabilities allows for the creation of highly-performing 
native haptic applications as well as for hybrid development where you 
can choose which components provide the best haptic and visual user 
experience.

Dependencies
============
On Ubuntu, the software depends on libasound2, libusb-1.0.0, freeglut3, xorg, libglew.
```
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libusb-1.0.0-dev freeglut3-dev xorg-dev libglew-dev
```
